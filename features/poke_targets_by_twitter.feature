  Scenario: when I have a Twitter authorization
    Given I'm logged in
    And there is a campaign with poke type "twitter"
    And there is a target for this campaign
    And I have a Twitter authorization
    And I'm in this campaign page
    When I press "the Twitter poke button"
    Then a twitter poke should be added to the target
    And an email should be sent
