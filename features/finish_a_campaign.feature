  In order to stop pokes
  As an admin
  I want to finish a campaign

  @omniauth_test
  Scenario: I'm logged in as admin
    Given I'm logged in as admin
    And there is a campaign called "Save the Whales!"
    And I'm in this campaign page
    When I click "Encerrar campanha"
    Then I should be in this campaign page
    And I should see "Vit√≥ria! Esta campanha foi encerrada"
    And I should not see "the pokes buttons" in "the right sidebar"

  Scenario: I'm not logged in
    Given there is a campaign called "Save the Whales!"
    When I go to this campaign page
